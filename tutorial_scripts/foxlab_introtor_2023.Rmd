# Overview
This document is designed to provide an introduction to using R for basic data
manipulation, visualization and analyses. This document assumes the user knows
how to set-up R. More information about setting-up are can be found [here](https://github.com/auv27/intro_to_r/tree/main/getting_started).

This document is known as an RMarkdown. RMarkdown is a useful tool for 
integrating text and code. It is also possible to use basic r scripts to conduct
any processes shown here.


# Loading packages
The code I am including here will automatically install and load packages that 
are needed for the script to run. Some people don't like this and prefer the
choice of what to install so just be cognizant. If you do not want to install 
everything, you can use `install.packages()` to install individual packages and
`library()` to load individual packages.

In the call below, I load [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) which is a 
package containing a family of packages. For this script, I am using the 
following tidyverse packages: stringr, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2. I will also use 
the psych and Hmisc packages.
```{r}
if (!("pacman" %in% installed.packages()[,])) {
    install.packages("pacman")
  }
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, psych, Hmisc)
```


# Setting up an environment
There are a few different ways to set-up an environment for manipulating,
analyzing and visualizing data in R. Some people like to use [projects](https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/starting-your-r-projects.html).
Others prefer to [set a working directory](https://finnstats.com/2021/12/30/get-and-set-working-directory-setwd-getwd-in-r/)
using `setwd()`.

I prefer to use relative paths because of the flexibility it affords, but there
is no right or wrong way to set-up an environment. Just choose what works best
for you.
```{r}
# Set home path - level that contains all needed folders 
## Using the str_wrap() function from stringr just to make the path readable
## You would need to adjust this path to match the location you want
home_path <- str_wrap("/Users/aliciavallorani/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Standard Codes/intro_to_r")

# Set data path 
data_path <- file.path(home_path,"/tutorial_data/candy_data.csv", fsep = "")

# Set ouput path
output_path <- file.path(home_path,"/tutorial_output", fsep = "")
```


# Reading in data
Today we only have one data file to read in which is relatively straightforward.
Reading in multiple files (such as reading in separate behavioral task files for
every individual participant) is a more advanced concept that I am happy to 
discuss individually or in a future tutorial. Merging 1 or 2 data sets is also a 
concept I'm happy to discuss individually or in a future tutorial.

The data for today are drawn from the 539 article 
["The Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/).
You can learn more about the data set [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking).
```{r}
# Read-in the data
candy_df <- read.csv(data_path)
```
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <p><strong>Variable definitions as provided by 539</strong></p>

</div>
For binary variables 1 = yes and 0 = no

# Looking at your data
Once you have read-in a data set, you can click on it in the "environment" tab
and a new window will appear. You can also check your data in script. R users
commonly refer to a read-in data set as a "data.frame" (hence the use of df to 
commonly label data.frames). You can use the `head()` function to observe the 
first few rows of your data.frame and the `str()` function to observe variable
types contained in your data.frame.
```{r}
# Observe the first few rows of your data.frame
head(candy_df)

# Observe the structure of your data.frame
str(candy_df)
```


# Manipulating your data
We can see from the `str()` function that the data read-in the binary variables
as integers, but we actually know they are factors. Although maybe we also think
that having more candy attributes might be related to some of our other variables,
such as how winning the candy was. Or maybe we think that candy that contains 
chocolate will have higher average win percentages than candy without chocolate.
We can use tidyverse functions to prepare the data to ask these questions.

First, lets create a variable that adds all the possible candy attributes 
together for each candy. We will use the `rowwise()` and `mutate()` functions 
which comes from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) package. 
```{r}
# Sum candy attributes
candy_df <- candy_df |>
  ## rowwise() tells the data.frame to calculate by rows
  rowwise() |>
  ## mutate() allows you to flexibly manipulate data
  mutate(candyattributesum = sum(across(2:10))) |>
  ## as_data_frame() returns the data from rowwise to data.frame format
  as_data_frame()

# Observe new variable
## select(), also from dplyr, let's you choose particular variables 
head(candy_df |> select(competitorname, candyattributesum))
```

Great! We see we created a new variable that sums candy attributes. What if we 
want to create winning averages based on candy features? For simplicity, let's
look at chocolate vs fruity candies. I am going to create a new data.frame that
focuses on those two candy types using `filter()` from dplyr.
```{r}
# Create average winning scores
candy_chocolateevsfruity_df <- candy_df |>
  # This tells the data.frame to keep candy labeled as chocolate or fruity
  filter(chocolate == 1 | fruity == 1) |>
  # Creating a new variable to label the groups
  mutate(type = ifelse(chocolate == 1, 1,
                       ifelse(fruity == 1, 2, NA))) |>
  select(competitorname, type, winpercent) 

# Observe resulting data.frame
head(candy_chocolateevsfruity_df)
```

Next, I am going to use `group_by()` from dplyr to find the averaage win percent
for chocolate vs fruity candy.
```{r}
candy_chocolateevsfruity_df <- candy_chocolateevsfruity_df |>
  group_by(type) |>
  mutate(averagewinpercent = mean(winpercent)) |>
  select(competitorname, type, averagewinpercent)

# Observe resulting data.frame
head(candy_chocolateevsfruity_df)
```
