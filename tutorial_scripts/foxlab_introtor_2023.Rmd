# Overview
This document is designed to provide an introduction to using R for basic data
manipulation, visualization and analyses. This document assumes the user knows
how to set-up R. More information about setting-up are can be found [here](https://github.com/auv27/intro_to_r/tree/main/getting_started).

This document is known as an RMarkdown. RMarkdown is a useful tool for 
integrating text and code. It is also possible to use basic r scripts to conduct
any processes shown here.


# Loading packages
The code I am including here will automatically install and load packages that 
are needed for the script to run. Some people don't like this and prefer the
choice of what to install so just be cognizant. If you do not want to install 
everything, you can use `install.packages()` to install individual packages and
`library()` to load individual packages.

In the call below, I load [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) which is a 
package containing a family of packages. All Tidyverse packages use a common
"grammar" for coding and I will use this throughout the script. It is also 
possible to do many of the same processes I show using base R or other packages,
but I find Tidyverse the most useful for consistency. For this script, I am 
using the following tidyverse packages: stringr, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2. 
I will also use the psych, Hmisc, GGally and viridis packages which are not
a part of the Tidyverse but work within the Tidyverse grammar.
```{r}
if (!("pacman" %in% installed.packages()[,])) {
    install.packages("pacman")
  }
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, psych, Hmisc, GGally, viridis)
```


# Setting up an environment
There are a few different ways to set-up an environment for manipulating,
analyzing and visualizing data in R. Some people like to use [projects](https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/starting-your-r-projects.html).
Others prefer to [set a working directory](https://finnstats.com/2021/12/30/get-and-set-working-directory-setwd-getwd-in-r/)
using `setwd()`.

I prefer to use relative paths because of the flexibility it affords, but there
is no right or wrong way to set-up an environment. Just choose what works best
for you.
```{r}
# Set home path - level that contains all needed folders 
## You would need to adjust this path to match the location you want
home_path <- "/Users/aliciavallorani/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Standard Codes/intro_to_r"

# Set data path 
data_path <- file.path(home_path,"/tutorial_data/candy_data.csv", fsep = "")
```

I personally always like to preset my visualization environment by sourcing in 
a visualization theme for all my plots.
```{r}
source("/Users/aliciavallorani/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Standard Codes/visualization_tools/basic_theme.R")
theme_set(basic_theme)
```


# Reading in data
Today we only have one data file to read in which is relatively straightforward.
Reading in multiple files (such as reading in separate behavioral task files for
every individual participant) is a more advanced concept that I am happy to 
discuss individually or in a future tutorial. Merging 2 or more data sets is 
also a concept I'm happy to discuss individually or in a future tutorial.

The data for today are drawn from the 539 article 
["The Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/).
You can learn more about the data set [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking).
```{r}
# Read-in the data
candy_df <- read.csv(data_path)
```
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <p><strong>Variable definitions as provided by 539</strong></p>
  <img src="/Users/aliciavallorani/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Standard Codes/intro_to_r/tutorial_scripts/tutorial_images/candy_variable_definitions.png" alt="Alt Text" />
</div>
For binary variables 1 = yes and 0 = no


# Looking at your data
Once you have read-in a data set, you can click on it in the "environment" tab
and a new window will appear. You can also check your data in script. R users
commonly refer to a read-in data set as a "data.frame" (hence the use of df to 
commonly label data.frames). You can use the `head()` function to observe the 
first few rows of your data.frame and the `str()` function to observe variable
types contained in your data.frame.
```{r}
# Observe the first few rows of your data.frame
head(candy_df)

# Observe the structure of your data.frame
str(candy_df)
```


# Manipulating your data
We can see from the `str()` function that the data read-in the binary variables
as integers, but we actually know they are factors. We can adjust this using the
`mutate()` function which comes from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) 
package.
```{r}
# Turn one integer variable into a factor
candy_df <- candy_df |>
  mutate(chocolate_factor = as.factor(chocolate))

# Observe the structure of your data.frame
str(candy_df)
```

But maybe we aren't all that interested in each of these candy attributes 
separately. Instead, maybe we think that having more candy attributes might be 
related to some of our other variables, such as how winning the candy was. 
Or maybe we think that candy that contains chocolate will have higher average 
win percentages than candy without chocolate. We can use tidyverse functions to 
prepare the data to ask these questions.

First, lets create a variable that adds all the possible candy attributes 
together for each candy. We will use the `rowwise()` and `mutate()` functions 
which comes from the dplyr package. 
```{r}
# Sum candy attributes
candy_df <- candy_df |>
  ## rowwise() tells the data.frame to calculate by rows
  rowwise() |>
  ## mutate() allows you to flexibly manipulate data
  mutate(candyattributesum = sum(across(2:10))) |>
  ## as_data_frame() returns the data from rowwise to data.frame format
  as.data.frame()

# Observe new variable
## select(), also from dplyr, let's you choose particular variables 
head(candy_df |> select(competitorname, candyattributesum))
```

Great! We see we created a new variable that sums candy attributes. What if we 
want to create winning averages based on candy features? For simplicity, let's
look at chocolate vs fruity candies. I am going to create a new data.frame that
focuses on those two candy types using `filter()` from dplyr.
```{r}
# Create average winning scores
candy_chocolatevsfruity_df <- candy_df |>
  # This tells the data.frame to keep candy labeled as chocolate or fruity
  filter(chocolate == 1 | fruity == 1) |>
  # Creating a new variable to label the groups
  mutate(type = ifelse(chocolate == 1, 1,
                       ifelse(fruity == 1, 2, NA))) |>
  select(competitorname, type, winpercent) 

# Observe resulting data.frame
head(candy_chocolatevsfruity_df)
```

Next, I am going to use `group_by()` from dplyr to find the average win percent
for chocolate vs fruity candy.
```{r}
candy_chocolatevsfruity_df <- candy_chocolatevsfruity_df |>
  group_by(type) |>
  mutate(averagewinpercent = mean(winpercent)) |>
  select(competitorname, type, winpercent, averagewinpercent)

# Observe resulting data.frame
head(candy_chocolatevsfruity_df)
```


# Analyzing and visualizing your data
We now have two data.frames ready for different analyses. Let's start by 
checking our descriptive statistics. I am going to use the `describe()` function
from the psych package.
```{r}
psych::describe(candy_df |> select(11:14))
```

We can also get summaries about our chocolate vs fruity groupings. I am using
the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions from dplyr
```{r}
candy_chocolatevsfruity_df |> 
  group_by(type) |>
  summarise(n())
```

Now let's check the correlations between our variables. I am going to use the
`rcorr()` function from Hmisc.
```{r}
rcorr(as.matrix(candy_df |> select(11:14), type = "pearson"))
```

Our correlations look pretty decent! But it is always preferable to visualize
correlations. There are a couple way you can do this, but first I will show you
`ggpairs()` from the GGally package as it is my favorite way to present 
descriptive data.
```{r}
ggpairs(candy_df |> select(11:14), progress = FALSE)
```

If you really wanted to focus on a particular relation, such as the relation 
between number of candy attributes and win percentage, you might instead use
`ggplot()` from the ggplot2 package in tidyverse.
```{r}
ggplot(candy_df, aes(sugarpercent, winpercent)) +
  geom_point()
```

Maybe now you want to see the line of best fit for the relation.
```{r}
ggplot(candy_df, aes(sugarpercent, winpercent)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black")
```

Maybe you're curious if this relation varies by number of candy attributes.
```{r}
ggplot(candy_df, aes(sugarpercent, winpercent)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~candyattributesum)
```

We can run a linear model to see if both sugar percent and candy attributes 
contribute to win percent.
```{r}
lm <- with(candy_df, lm(winpercent ~ sugarpercent + candyattributesum))

summary(lm)
```

Maybe now you want to know more about our chocolate vs fruity candy question.
We can run a t-test to see if chocolate or fruity candy has higher win percents.
```{r}
with(candy_chocolatevsfruity_df, t.test(winpercent~type))
```

We can make a bar graph to visualize this difference. I am going to use the
Rmisc package to calculate error bars for the figure.
```{r}
library(Rmisc)
candy_chocolatevsfruitysummary_df <- summarySEwithin(candy_chocolatevsfruity_df,
                           measurevar="winpercent", 
                           withinvars=c("type"),
                           #idvar="type", 
                           na.rm=TRUE, conf.interval=.95)
detach("package:Rmisc", unload=TRUE)
```


Now I am going to plot the bar graph. When I add color to a graph, I like to
use the viridis package as it is colorblind friendly.
```{r}
ggplot(candy_chocolatevsfruitysummary_df, aes(type, winpercent, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  geom_errorbar(position = position_dodge(.9), width = .1, 
                aes(ymin=winpercent-se, 
                    ymax=winpercent+se)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = .2, end = .8)  
```

Maybe we decide this is the story we really want to tell: the superiority of 
chocolate over fruity candies. We can dress up this figure to make it publication
ready by adding more informative labels.
```{r}
candy_figure <- ggplot(candy_chocolatevsfruitysummary_df, 
                       aes(type, winpercent, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  geom_errorbar(position = position_dodge(.9), width = .1, 
                aes(ymin=winpercent-se, 
                    ymax=winpercent+se)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = .2, end = .8, labels = c("Chocolate", "Fruity")) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Win Percent", fill = "Candy Type") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

candy_figure
```

Now we can export this figure for publication!
```{r}
out_path <- file.path(home_path,"/tutorial_output/candy_figure.png", fsep ="")
ggsave(out_path, plot = candy_figure, width = 6, height = 4, dpi = 300)
```

# Summary
This was a very speedy run through of some of the things you can do with R. 
However, often issues with data, analyses and visualization end up being much
more complicated than what we did today. We can look at more advanced topics on
a case-by-case basis or in future tutorials which could cover topics like 
manipulating and analyzing longitudinal data, visualizing interactions, etc.
